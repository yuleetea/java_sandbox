       Create an integer array method called BiggerTwo that takes in two integer arrays "a" and "b".  Both integer arrays, a and b, have a length of 2.  Consider the sum of the values in each array and return the array which has the largest sum.  In the event of a tie, return a:

Example:  biggerTwo([1, 2], [3, 4]) =>  [3,4]
                biggerTwo([3,4], [1,2]  =>  [3,4]
